cd schedulify
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

**Install all dependencies**:

From the project root directory:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the **backend** folder with the following content:

```bash
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

PORT=3000
JWT_TOKEN=your_token
```

Create a `.env` file inside the **frontend** folder with the following content:

```bash

### 5️⃣ Set Up SSH Tunnel to Remote Database

Run this command from your local machine:

```bash
ssh -L 3307:127.0.0.1:3306 YOUR_USERNAME@blue.cs.sonoma.edu
```

Keep this terminal open while working, or run it in the background.

### 6️⃣ Run the Application

From the project root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will use **concurrently** to start both servers:

- **Backend:** Node.js with automatic reload (`node --watch app.js`)
- **Frontend:** Vite development server

You can also run them individually:

```bash
npm run backend
npm run frontend
```
